# Radar_classification
In this project we classified the objects based on the features extracted from range FFT from mmWave radar. 
## Dataset
The entire dataset is found here https://drive.google.com/file/d/1f2t5KJqbpsqW9dV6X8CI3ZIrhuFNI2jV/view?usp=sharing .
### Description 
1. Total samples: 226
2. Total classes: 3 ( Car, Drone, Human)
3. Total no. of features: 5 ( Distance, Area, Height, Width, Standard Deviation)
## Models
In this project 4 machine learning models were apllied on the above mentioned dataset and their performance was evaluated.
### Logistic Regression
1.The file Log_reg.ipynb consists of the logistic regression model. This file consists of all the steps from loading the dataset to training and then testing and saing the trained model.

2. The trained logistic regression model can be found here https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ZQKDnykqlbd5GMcEdsWefS52N7LU-AIp/view?usp=sharing .

### Naive Bayes
1.The file Naive_Bayes.ipynb consists of the Naives Bayes model. This file consists of all the steps from loading the dataset to training and then testing and saing the trained model.
